A range of combinations are utilized to categorize images captured by dark field microscopy with support vector machine from distinct species of agave, thereby generating four distinct varieties of mezcal. In each approach, a series of iterations are conducted to identify the optimal parameters.

ROC Curve and performance metrics are included in a separate code file.

It has been determined that the code in question is associated with a work that is currently undergoing a review process.
