A range of combinations are utilized to categorize images captured by dark field microscopy, employing the support vector machine (SVM) classification methodology. In each approach, a series of iterations are conducted to identify the optimal parameters.

ROC Curve and performance metrics are included in a separate code file.

It has been determined that the code in question is associated with a work that is currently undergoing a review process.
